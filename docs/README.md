# PsychFlow – Progressive Web App for Psychologists

## The Problem

Psychologists waste 2-3 hours weekly on administrative overhead:
- **Lost patient notes** and missed appointments due to paper-based systems
- **Manual reminder calls** that patients ignore or forget
- **Excel spreadsheets** that break with complex patient data and session tracking
- **Switching between 5+ tools** for basic practice management (calendar, notes, billing, contacts)
- **No reliable system** for tracking patient progress and therapy outcomes

**Result:** Less time for actual therapy, frustrated patients, and reduced practice efficiency.

## The Solution

**PsychFlow: One app. All patients. Zero hassle.**

A lightweight, installable Progressive Web App designed specifically for solo and small-practice psychologists. Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile - online or offline.
